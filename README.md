# XGBoost-Stock-Price-Prediction

## Introduction

This script loads desired stock price training data, trains an XGBoost Regressor for Time Series Forecasting (allowing fine-tuning) and downloads the model to be used for prediction tasks. Specifically, it attempst to predict the following day's adjusted close price based on former days' adjusted close prices.

## XGBoost


XGBoost is a scalable end to-end tree boosting system, which is a highly effective and widely used machine learning method [1]. It is a system that outperforms deep learning models (and also requires much less tuning) on classification and regression problems for tabular data across multiple datasets
